Note that I did not use a SmartBot. It's functions are covered by the other robots in this package.

BetterTurnerRobot: A robot with a bunch of turning commands, as well as moveBackward() because one of the problems insisted.
BetterMoverRobot: A robot with a bunch of moving commands based on BetterTurnerRobot's turning. Mostly methods for going to walls as well as abbreviations for common methods.
BoolBot: A robot with two boolean methods that return booleans based on whether the left or right is clear.
